# Some background
I'm about a trading network, cooperating to mutual benefit rather then competing, bringing each other up rather then overstraining for a lesser success at the cost of the competitors.

I'm about freedom and enjoying life. I beleive, thru cooperation, we can free each other to do what each is best at and likes most, to be efficient and to have time left to enjoy freedom. Simply, cooperation is a smarter, saner option.

So, i welcome everybody to collobarate with me, to become trading partner of myself and anybody in my trading network.

I am into building a self sustaining community with its own economy inspired by open source movement. A community with a common goal - individual freedom.

I think, it is essential that each trader within network is rewarded farly in propotion to his effort and skills. How that reward is determined is subject to free negotiations between parties involved. Everything is negotiable, however, i have a few guideline principles.

# The minimum i expect from my collaborators
1. I want us to treat each other as traders/intreprenuers and not as employer/emploeer with predefined set of expectations.
2. Complete transparancy for all aspects of the project. Remember, we are helping each other succeed, not trying to outcompete each other
3. Each should be rewarded for his share in each project. The reward is negotiable and should be determined at the very start based on known information at the moment.
4. Each collobarator should be honest to himself and to all involved about the value of his contribution.
5. Negotiated terms are subject to reason at any time.
6. The reward is not always/often monetary. I highly encourage trading services. Though, not always possible, trading is a lot more efficient and money is often the wrong incentive.
